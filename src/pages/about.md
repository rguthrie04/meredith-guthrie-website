### Core Skills

My academic journey and professional experience have equipped me with a robust skillset essential for rigorous historical inquiry:

*   **Archival Research & Paleography:** Extensive experience navigating physical and digital archives, coupled with expertise in reading and interpreting historical handwriting and scripts from the late-medieval and early modern periods.
*   **Historical Languages:** Proficiency in Latin and late-medieval French, enabling direct engagement with primary source materials.
*   **Research & Analysis:** Trained in advanced academic research methodologies, historical analysis, and contextualizing findings within the broader historical landscape.
*   **Writing & Content Creation:** Skilled in crafting clear, engaging, and accurate historical narratives for both academic and public audiences.
*   **Digital Humanities:** Competent in database development for managing and analyzing historical data, including prosopographical analysis (the study of collective biographies).

I am passionate about bringing the past to life and applying these skills to diverse projects. Whether you're developing a documentary, creating historical content, tracing family history, or researching corporate archives, I offer meticulous research and insightful analysis.
